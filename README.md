# MATLAB : Improving Performance

This workshop will cover basic performance optimization techniques using MATLAB, including: code profiling, pre-allocation, sequential memory access, vectorization, and efficient matrix-vector storage and operations. We will assume that participants have a basic understanding of the MATLAB programming language.
